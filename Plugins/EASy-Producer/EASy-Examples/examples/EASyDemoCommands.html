        <h2>EASy Command Platform Example</h2>
        Demonstrates a hierarchical product line of a command executor platform. The platform provides
        some mandatory and optional commands as well as basic instantiation capabilities. The refining
        product lines instantiate or extend the platform in different manner, in particular
        <ul>
        <li><b>EASyDemoCommandsConstants:</b> Instantiate by modifying Java source code constants.</li>
        <li><b>EASyDemoCommandsFile:</b> Instantiate by removing unneeded Java source code artifacts.</li>
        <li><b>EASyDemoCommandsGen:</b> Instantiate by generating a properties file for startup time variability.
           In addition, this product line allows to integrate arbitrary simple commands, which are frontended by
           generated glue code.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><b>EASyDemoCommandsGenStatic:</b> Instantiate by removing generating Java source code for a 
           constants class.</li> 
        <li><b>EASyDemoCommandsVelocity:</b> Instantiate using Apache Velocity.</li>        
        <br/><br/>
        <i>Please derive a product first before configuring and instantiating. Actually, the platform 
           EASyDemoCommandsPlatform does not provide own instantiation functionality.</i>
