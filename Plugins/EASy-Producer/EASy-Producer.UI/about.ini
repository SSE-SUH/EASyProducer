aboutText=EASy-Producer is a prototypical tool for the development of Software Product Lines (SPL). EASy stands for Engineering Adaptive Systems and describes the easy development, management and combination of SPLs with this tool. For this purpose, EASy-Producer integrates efficient techniques for the reduction complexity, and the composition and derivation of products. The Software Systems Engineering (SSE) group further develops these techniques continuously. The focus is, in particular, on the support for the development of large-scale and complex SPLs.

EASy-Producer supports the following approaches:
\n\n
    Multi-staged product configuration\n
    Multi-dimensional variability modeling\n
    Multi-Software Product Lines
\n\n
These principles are the state of the art in research on large-scale and complex SPLs. Further, EASy-Producer is based on the following principles:\n
\n\n
    Extensibility for product-specific requirements\n
    Products as configurable product lines\n
    Conceptual simplicity
\n\n
Based on a decision modeling approach, the current prototype supports the description of the common and variable parts of a product line. The decisions towards a configuration of partial product lines or complete products are the basis for the automated instantiation of the corresponding software artifacts on the implementation level.
