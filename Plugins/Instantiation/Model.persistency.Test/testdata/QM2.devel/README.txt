Please note:
- Source code artifacts / required libraries are currently committed for testing. In a later stage, we will remove them.
- Changes to structures may immediately become available to the QM2 Configuration application, i.e., committing erroneous models 
  will cause troubles to all involved parties. 
- Please consider the readme.txt of the QM2 Configuration application for more details regarding the implicit requirements and
  rules in the model structure.

Documentation:
- We rely on the most recent version of IVML/VIL/VTL. The most recent documentation is in the EASy SVN at SUH. Please contact us for access.
- The documentation of the release version can be obtained from 
  - http://projects.sse.uni-hildesheim.de/easy/docs/ivml_spec.pdf
  - http://projects.sse.uni-hildesheim.de/easy/docs/vil_spec.pdf 
   
Potential future changes:
- real type hierarchy
- buffer size as fixed parameter in Source
- multiple roles for general purpose hardware
- tuple names (somehow)
